Traits of a good windowing environment for terminal-centric users.

* Consistent
* Functional
* Clean
* Expressive
* Unobtrusive
* Quick

Consistent behavior
Keyboard shortcuts must be the same across applications.
Copy and paste keys must be consistent across terminals, browsers,
graphical editors and so forth.

Focus
Window focus must maintain state when changing virtual desktops.

Clean
Unimportant features must be removable.

Quick
Fast reaction to user input is noticeable.

Unobtrusive
Features must align with the user's intent.

Positive example
Size-Up with OS-X provides quick application startup, quick window creation, manipulation, and consistent termination.  Each window should behave the same when Command-W, Command-N, or Command-Q is pressed.  A user can choose to avoid the mouse.  Window focus is consistent when changing desktops and behaves as a stack.
